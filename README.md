# Olympics Data Analysis Project üèÖ

## Overview
This project automates the extraction, transformation, and analysis of Olympics data using a combination of Python, SQL Server, and Tableau.

### Key Features
- **Automated Data Extraction**: A Python script that downloads the latest Olympics dataset from Kaggle, unzips it, and converts CSV files to Excel format.
- **Data Storage and Analysis**: The transformed data is stored in SQL Server, where crucial insights are derived using SQL queries.
- **Dynamic Dashboards**: The analyzed data is visualized through interactive Tableau dashboards. The user can filter based on the country and get important information about various statistics. 

## Data Source
The dataset is sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/piterfm/paris-2024-olympic-summer-games), where it was updated daily during the course of Paris Olympics 2024.

## Project Structure
- `scripts/`: Contains the Python scripts for data extraction and transformation.
- `sql/`: SQL queries used for data analysis.
- `data/`: Contains the extracted and transformed data.
- `dashboards/`: Tableau dashboard images and related files.

## How It Works
1. **Data Extraction & Transformation**:
   - A Python script is scheduled via Windows Task Scheduler to run daily, ensuring the data is always up-to-date.
   - The script downloads the dataset, unzips it, converts CSV files to Excel, and stores them in a specified directory.

2. **Data Analysis**:
   - The Excel files are imported into SQL Server.
   - Various SQL queries are used to join relevant tables and extract meaningful insights from the data.
   - There are few queries that extract data relevant for Dashboard Development. 

3. **Data Visualization**:
   - The analyzed data is connected to Tableau, where dynamic dashboards are created to visualize key metrics and trends.
   - I have tried to gather as much insights possible as to athlete's age, demographics and likewise.
